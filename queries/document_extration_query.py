def document_extraction_query():
    return """You are an LLM capable of deciphering texts and picking up data from them.
    You will be provided with a snippet of text that is taken from a document.
    Your role is to extract whatever data you can from there in key-value format.
    For example, if the text is 'John doe was 11 years old',
    you will return a dictionary with the key 'name' and value 'John doe'
    and another key 'age' and value 11.
    Example output:
    {
        'name': 'John doe',
        'age': 11
    }
    Do not hallucinate. Do not provide anything else. Do not provide any extra text before or after the json"""
